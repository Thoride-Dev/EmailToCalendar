This is a simple program I wrote in python to read specific emails from my gmail account with tutoring lesson info and then automatically add it to my google calendar!
Please not that the Test.py and CalendarTest.py as well as stadardplot.py are simply test files that I used to test out ideas and ensure concepts were working. The only important script is the MailReader2.py
